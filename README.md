# VBA-challenge

   In this challenge, I used VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data. Creating a loop (that went throughout three worksheets) I created the following outputs: 
        - The yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of the year to the closing prince at the end of the year. If there was a negative change, the number would be highlighted in red, and with positive changes, the numbers would be highlighted in green.
        - The percentage change from the beginning price to the ending price of the year. 
        - The total stock volume of the stock. 

    There was a summary included in the VBA script, finding the Greatest % Increase, Greatest % Decrease, and the Greatest Total Volume of each year.
